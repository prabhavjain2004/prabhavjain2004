# 💫 About Me
I'm **Prabhav Jain**, a systems and automation-focused engineer who builds real-world platforms that eliminate manual work and improve operational efficiency.  

I work across backend development, systems design, event workflows, and applied automation using Python, JavaScript, and modern web stacks. My primary focus is building reliable, production-grade systems with practical use — not prototypes.

### Key Interests
- Automation & workflow systems  
- Backend architecture & APIs  
- Cashless systems (NFC / QR)  
- Event & access-control systems  
- Applied AI for real-world tasks (not just prompts)  

### What I Do
- Build automation systems that reduce manual effort  
- Design APIs & service architectures using modern stacks  
- Integrate payment, authentication & logging systems  
- Develop lightweight AI tools for code & dev workflows  

### Currently Learning
- Scalable workflow & queue systems  
- Real-time infra (WebSockets, workers, Redis)  
- Efficient distributed system patterns  

### Ask Me About
- Building production automation systems  
- API-driven workflows and backend design  
- Practical AI/LLM systems for dev & ops automation  
- NFC / QR based event access & payment systems  

### Fun Thought
Automation isn't about avoiding work — it's about removing friction so systems run by themselves.
